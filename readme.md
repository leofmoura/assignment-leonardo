Given I have a list of categories, when I click on each category, then I expect to see the relevant coins displayed from primary and secondary providers with their price and price change.

[Story] [ Estimation expected ] [3]

Given I am viewing the categorized coins returned by primary & secondary market insight providers with price and price change within past 24 hours, when I click on any of the providerâ€™s price, then I expect to see the basic information about the coin such as price, change rate, market cap and price difference between the providers retrieved from respective provider.

[Story] [ Estimation expected ] [2]

Given I am viewing the categorized coins returned by the primary & secondary market Insight providers, when the symbol returned by primary market insight provider is not found at secondary market insight provider, then I expect to see N/A and it should not be clickable.

Given I am landed on a page that provides me the basic information of the coin, when I choose to go back to the overview page, then I should have a back button to do so.
